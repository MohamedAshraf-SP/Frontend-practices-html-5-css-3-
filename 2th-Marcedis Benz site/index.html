                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cars is a CGI-animated film series 
                    and Disney media franchise set in a world populated by
                     anthropomorphic vehicles created by John Lasseter. 
                     The franchise began with the 2006 film of the same name,
                      produced by Pixar and released by Walt Disney Pictures. 
                      The film was followed by a sequel in 2011. A third film was released in 2017. 
                      The now defunct Disneytoon Studios produced the two spin-off films Planes (2013) and Planes: Fire & Rescue (2014).

                    The first two Cars films were directed by Lasseter, then-chief creative officer of Pixar, Walt Disney Animation Studios, and Disneytoon Studios, while Cars 3 was directed by Brian Fee, a storyboard artist on the previous installments. Lasseter served as executive producer of Cars 3 and the Planes films. Together, the first three Cars films have accrued over $1.4 billion in 
                    box office revenue worldwide while the franchise has amassed over $10 billion in merchandising sales within its first 5 years.
